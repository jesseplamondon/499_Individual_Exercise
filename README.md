# Greatest Increasing Subset Feature

This feature allows the user to find the greatest increasing subset of the provided integer array.
An example of the usage of this feature is as follows, given an array of [1,2,3,2,8,1], the greatest increasing subset would be [2,8], as the integers are increasing as progression is made to the right, and the subset has a greater sum than any other increasing subset in the array (i.e. [1,2,3]).

# Sum Feature
This feature returns the sum of all of the integers in the array.
